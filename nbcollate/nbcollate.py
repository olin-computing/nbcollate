"""Collate an assignment and answer Jupyter notebooks into a single notebook.

This script is designed to support active reading.  It takes as input
a set of Jupyter notebooks as well as some target cells which define a set
of reading exercises.  The script processes the collection of notebooks
and builds a notebook which summarizes the responses to each question.

Based on work by Paul Ruvolo.
